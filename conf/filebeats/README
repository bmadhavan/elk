This document outlines the steps needed for INSTALLING and CONFIGURING filebeats on the host
from where the logs or data needs to shipped 


# To install filebeats version 5.2.0,
```sh
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-5.2.0-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i filebeat-5.2.0-amd64.deb
```

# To Edit
Edit the appropriate logstash server IP:port and SSL certs.

# Other settings controlled by filebeats.yml

## DATA source 
The above configuration picks all *.log files in '/var/log/socket_stat/' folder 

## Multiline  
Since ss has multiple lines of logs,
Anyline that starts with a space is considered as a continuation of the previous entry.
